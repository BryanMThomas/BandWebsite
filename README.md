# Band Website

**Simple site using HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS and a Node JS Web Server to expand my web development abilities**

## Skills Developed
Vanilla JS - Created a functioning store and shopping cart for mock band merchandise. Implemented the ability to add / remove items from the users cart and complete the purchase. 

Node JS Web Server - Created a basic web server to handle GET requests to surface the webpages of the site and a POST request to handle purchases of items in the cart. 

Stripe Checkout API - Integrated with Stripe Checkout API to process payments for purchases made from the cart. Used Public and Private Keys in order to make secure calls to my stripe account.
